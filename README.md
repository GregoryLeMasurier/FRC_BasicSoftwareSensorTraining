# FRC_BasicSoftwareSensorTraining

# THERE IS CURRENTLY NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS TRAINING AND https://github.com/GregoryLeMasurier/FRC_BasicSoftwareTraining . Still need to implement sensors and remove time.

This version of the software training was created as a follow up training (after https://github.com/GregoryLeMasurier/FRC_BasicSoftwareTraining ). It provides the students with easy to use method calls that will allow them to move a robot from a starting square, marked with tape, to an ending square. In this training the path they will need to follow will be more complicated than in the first training. In this training they will learn about using sensors to create a more accurate autonomous. Simple function calls allow for students without software experience to easily pick up and understand very basics of programming with a quick sense of accomplishment when they can get the robot to move within minutes.
